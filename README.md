# Warehouse Statistics Dashboard

This repository hosts the source code and documentation for a real-time Warehouse Statistics Dashboard tailored for workshop inventory management. The dashboard integrates with your IWMS (Integrated Workplace Management System) to provide essential insights at a glance.

- **One-Screen Display:** Responsive 55" 16:9 screen format for presenting summarized inventory information.
- **Data Integration:** Seamlessly connect to IWMS data sources.
- **User Management:** Basic user, role, and permission controls for data access and security.
